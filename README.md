This python programs upload stock data and find statistics data like standard deviation, variance, co-variance, yearly returns,skewness, kurtosis
of three crypto currency assets individually.
and then find an optimum portfolio which will give max retruns, max sharpe ratio or min volatitliy.
The portfolio will find out weights that each asset class should have for optimum outputs.
